This repository is for Dennis lab application. There is a pipeline code with python and a bash code instruction.

## This pipeline code is written in python3, so check your python version before you run this program.
How to check?
bash code:

If this command does not work, you have to download python3 at "https://www.python.org/downloads/"

## This program needs scikit learn library

You must install numpy and scipy before you install scikit learn if you do not have those.
